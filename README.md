Kinect-Earth 
============ 

## Initial Codebase by: 
Huyen Tran, Tatiana Iskandar, Hyunggu Jung, Daniel Strazzulla, and Daniel Onggunhao

## Description

Kinect-Earth is a project for Prof. Jeff Heer's Human-Computer Interaction course (CS247) at Stanford
University. It won the overall best design award, out of more 14 projects for that course.

It combines a custom Google Earth physics engine with a gesture controller built for the Kinect, to
allow users to navigate Google Earth's 3D virtual world using their bodies. Simple, intuitive and intensity-sensitive
gestures create a natural user interface.

## Gestures

*Move forward/backward*: Move right foot forwardbackward

*Turn left/right*: Rotate your shoulders left/right. The more you rotate, the greater the turn

*Jetpack*: Hold your arms in a "jetpack" gesture (picture coming soon). Raise your hands to your shoulder
to increase altitude, hold it at 90 degree angles to hover, and drop your hands to fall back to earth.
